# week 1 day 1, Graphs
1. How do we define graphs, where are they commonly used?

2. What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?

3. What are some ways we might stoer a graph in memory? What space/time complexity problems might we face?

 How do we define a graph mathematically?


 What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?


 Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)


 What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?


 What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? 
 Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of N


 Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).


 What are cycles?


 What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.
