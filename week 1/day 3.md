## BFS Graph/DFS Graph explanation

### DFS
- requires a stack
- Starting at the first node, or however you determine where to start, you add that node on the stack, and mark it is visited.
- then you look at its adjacent nodes and visit the lowest/first alphabetically/however you determine to traverse.  
  - you mark that one as visited, then continue this step for this current node
- you continue to visit the lowest node of each node until there are no nodes left to go
- then you go back through the stack, popping them off the stack if there are no new nodes left to visit, and there are no nodes left on the stack, then you are done.

- in this example we would go from A-B-E-G
  - then since G has nowhere to go, we would go back to E, which has nowhere, back to B
  - from B we would go to F
  - from F we go to C, then to H, then back to C, F, and then to D
  - from there we should have visited every node and have finished the traversal
  - our result visit owuld have been:
    - A B E G F C H D

## BFS
- Breadth first search utilizes a queue rather than a stack, meaning it is FIFO, rather last LIFO
- guess is that we will visit:
  - A B D G E F C H
- will start at A, but this time, we stay working on A, instead of moving to the next one
- we will visit them in order by alphabetical order/lowest just like in DFS, except we dont move our current node to the next one, but we do visit them
- when we run out of other vertices/nodes to visit, we will dequeue the first one and make it our current vertex/node

## DFS Search of graphs
- DFS similar to DF traveersal of a tree, except graphs could have cycles
- this means that we need to have a second object/array to indicate which nodes we have visted already.
- 
![DFS](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cycle.png)
- in this example, can end up in a cycle between 2-0 and 2-0-1 and 3-3
- we use a visited array so that we dont end up in a loop
- a correct DFS would have us visit 2-0-1-3

// C++ program to print DFS traversal from 
// a given vertex in a  given graph 
#include<iostream> 
#include<list> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Graph class represents a directed graph 
// using adjacency list representation 
class Graph 
{ 
    int V;    // No. of vertices 
  
    // Pointer to an array containing 
    // adjacency lists 
    list<int> *adj; 
  
    // A recursive function used by DFS 
    void DFSUtil(int v, bool visited[]); 
public: 
    Graph(int V);   // Constructor 
  
    // function to add an edge to graph 
    void addEdge(int v, int w); 
  
    // DFS traversal of the vertices 
    // reachable from v 
    void DFS(int v); 
}; 
  
Graph::Graph(int V) 
{ 
    this->V = V; 
    adj = new list<int>[V]; 
} 
  
void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w) 
{ 
    adj[v].push_back(w); // Add w to vâ€™s list. 
} 
  
void Graph::DFSUtil(int v, bool visited[]) 
{ 
    // Mark the current node as visited and 
    // print it 
    visited[v] = true; 
    cout << v << " "; 
  
    // Recur for all the vertices adjacent 
    // to this vertex 
    list<int>::iterator i; 
    for (i = adj[v].begin(); i != adj[v].end(); ++i) 
        if (!visited[*i]) 
            DFSUtil(*i, visited); 
} 
  
// DFS traversal of the vertices reachable from v. 
// It uses recursive DFSUtil() 
void Graph::DFS(int v) 
{ 
    // Mark all the vertices as not visited 
    bool *visited = new bool[V]; 
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) 
        visited[i] = false; 
  
    // Call the recursive helper function 
    // to print DFS traversal 
    DFSUtil(v, visited); 
} 
  
int main() 
{ 
    // Create a graph given in the above diagram 
    Graph g(4); 
    g.addEdge(0, 1); 
    g.addEdge(0, 2); 
    g.addEdge(1, 2); 
    g.addEdge(2, 0); 
    g.addEdge(2, 3); 
    g.addEdge(3, 3); 
  
    cout << "Following is Depth First Traversal"
            " (starting from vertex 2) \n"; 
    g.DFS(2); 
  
    return 0; 
} 
```
- this method utilizes a few helpers, first it adds the edges into the graph, then it visits the graph using DFS, and creates a boolean to check whether or not we've visited the nodes yet.

## What happens when you type in www.google.com?
1. Type in Maps.google.com
   
2. Browser checks cache for a DNS record to find corresponding IP address of google.com
- DNS(Domain Name System) is a database that maintains name of websites(URL) and the IP address linked to it
- every URL has a unique IP address, which belongs to the computer that hosts the server of the website that we are visiting.
- for example, google's IP is http://209.85.227.104, which you can visit
   - DNS is like a phonebook for websites, listing URLs and their respective IP addresses
- Browser will check four caches to find the DNS records
  - First, checks browser cache to see if it is in our list of previously visited sites, which our browser stores for a fixed duration
  - Second, browser checks the OS cache, a system call(i.e. gethostname on Windows) to your computer OS, since your computer also has a cache of DNS records
  - third, it checks the router cache, which stores its own records as well
  - Fourth, it checks the ISP(Internet service provider), last one
- not the best in terms of security, but cache's are important to network traffic and improving data transfer time.

3. If the request URL is not in the cache, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS request to find the IP address of the server that hosts google.com
- If the URL is not in any of the four caches, ISP's DNS will intiate a DNS query to find the IP address at the server that hosts the site you are trying to go to(maps.google.com)
- 
   
4. browser initiates a TCP connection with the server
   
5. the browser sends an http request to the web server
   
6. server handles the request and sends back a response
   
7. server sounds out an HTTP response
   
8. browser displays the HTML content(for html responses which is the most common)
